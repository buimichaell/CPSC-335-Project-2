# CPSC 335 - Project 2

   **Overview**: Implementation of Project 2 for CPSC-335:

   * Algorithm 1 - Movement of Knights: Uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm via Python for Chess using Knights to find the shortest number of steps between two coordinates, marking each visited step so the Knights can not return.

   * Algorithm 2 - String Run Encoding: Using if-else statements and a for-loop, this algorithm iterates through each character in a given string and outputs a new string where each run of ***k*** repitions of the character ***x*** is replaced by a string "***kx***"

   * Programming language used for both algorithms: Python.

## Execution:

   1. Algorithm 1 program takes output from `output.txt` and prints the result of 1.

      * **Linux**: Type `python3 algorithmn1.py` into the console from the appropriate directory(Algorithm 1).
      * **VS Code**: Open Algorithm 1 file, navigate to `algorithm1.py`, and run it.

   2. Algorithm 2 program takes input from `input.txt`.

      * **Linux**: Type `python3 algo2.py` into the console from the appropriate directory(Algorithm2).
